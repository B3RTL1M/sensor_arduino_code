MPU6050
Created by B3RTL1M
This code is completely open source, and you may edit it however you like. 
Please support the Arduino community, and upload any bug fixes to the relative
page. 
Keep in mind that the code is for demonstration purposes only, I can't be
held responsible if your device suddenly zaps you into millions of little
atoms, and you live the rest of your existence in a quantum universe where
nothing makes sense anymore (you know, you exist in more than one place, changing
between matter and waves, while at the same time half your electrons are entangled
in some other point in space and time). 
Other than that, enjoy... =D
